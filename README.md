# Manga Stitcher

Manga Stitcher is a straightforward tool designed to automatically combine manga pages vertically, creating a seamless reading experience. Many manga releases include extra "tail" images—often containing the scanlator's logo or credits—in separate files. This script detects and merges these pages, saving you time and ensuring your manga is presented as intended.

## Features

- Supports input from directories full of CBZ/CBR/ZIP/RAR files.
- Outputs stitched images in the same format.
- Optionally recursive directory traversal.
- Configurable title and series metadata
- Safety checks for width and height mismatches. (skips)
